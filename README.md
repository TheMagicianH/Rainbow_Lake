A “Black Market” on The Surface Web. This market has everything you need. Dark web is too dark and too hard to access for most people. What happens if an old man feels ashamed for collecting teddy bears? There are many users who don’t want the market or the website to know what they are buying. This website helps all the people to keep their tiny secrets while keeping the transactions safe. The buyers don’t know the sellers but their ratings. The sellers don’t know the buyers and not even their address (We do the delivery). The website itself doesn’t care about what product they are selling. This is a safe system where everyone gets what they want.
